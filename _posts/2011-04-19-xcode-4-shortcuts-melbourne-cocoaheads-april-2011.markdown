Stewart Gleadow ([@StewGleadow][1]) and I did a quick presentation at Cocoaheads this month highlighting some of our favourite (or more obscure) Xcode 4 shortcuts.

The main take away of the whole exercise for me was finally memorising the shortcut symbols. This has vastly improved my ability to remember new shortcuts. I suggest you do the same!

Stew has posted answers to some of the questions over on his [blog][2].
