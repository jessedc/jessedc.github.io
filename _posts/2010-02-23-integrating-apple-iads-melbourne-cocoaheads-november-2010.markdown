I'm presenting a talk tonight at Melbourne CocoaHeads on implementing Apple's iAd framework. I'll be going over how to add the iAd framework to your project, a handful of things to remember about using iAds and an overview my first hand experiences with Seoul City Metro as an iAd supported app.

I will be showing some code I have recently sourced a named [JCAdSupportedNavController][2] that provides a good way to implement iAds in a UINavigationController. You can check it out on [github][2].

The sides for the presentation are up on [slideshare][3]
