Just a quick post to highlight some upcoming events I'm getting excited about.

If you're reading this and attending WWDC or Swipe Conference then [hit me up on Twitter][1] and we'll coordinate beers.

First up is **WWDC 2011** in San Francisco. - I didn't go last year and this year I'm flying up along side a handful of Melbourne iOS developers from the Melbourne Cocoaheads group and the [Itty Bitty Apps][2] guys, [Sean Woodhouse][3] and [Oliver Jones][4]. There's a Pre-WWDC catch up in Richmond/Cremorne in Melbourne on 1/6/11 being organised by [Intunity][5] and I will be attending that too.

Later in the year is **Swipe Conference** ([swipeconference.com.au][6], [@swipeconf][7]), September 5 - 7 in Melbourne is the next big thing for iOS Developers and looking at the line up it's going to be a great three days. I'm hoping it brings in the iOS developers from near and far that have yet to turn up at a Cocoaheads meet - there's a lot of developers out there.

I'm also attending TEDxSydney on the 28th of May, but since I missed out on a proper ticket I'll be hanging out out the front all day like I did last year.
