To coincide with my [February 2012 Cocoaheads][1] presentation I have open sourced a component named JCTiledScrollView. 

JCTiledScrollView is a set of classes that wrap UIScrollView and CATiledLayer. The project to simplify displaying large images and PDFs at multiple zoom scales. As the project evolves it's moving towards becoming a fully featured custom map view replacement with gestures and annotations.

Check out JCTiledScrollView on [github][4].
