I was originally made aware of TED and TEDx events while in Seoul, reading Chang-Won Kim's [Web 2.0 Asia Weblog][1]. He was speaking at an upcoming technology event called [TEDxSeoul][2]. The rest is history. 

**Update 2013:** I have since attended TEDxSydney twice, TEDxMelbourne and TEDxCanberra over the last few years.

Here's my favourite TED videos in no particular order:

 * Steve Jobs: [How to live before you die][4] Stanford University June 2005
 * JK Rowling: [The fringe benefits of failure][3] Harvard University June 2008
 * David Blaine: [How I held my breath for 17 minutes][5] TEDMED2009
 * Bill Gates on [mosquitos, malaria and education][6] TED 2009
 * Bill Gates on energy: [Innovating to zero!][7] TED 2010
 * Brian Cox on [CERN's supercollider][8] TED 2008
