Luke Cunningham ([@icaruswings][1]) and I presented a talk at the June 2011 Cocoaheads meet up titled *"Epic refactorings and patterns to make your code awesome!"*.

The topic was inspired by a number of design patterns we employed while developing the new realestate.com.au iPad application. We highlighted some of shortcomings we found with UIViewController and demonstrated our end result - **ViewCoordinator**

The book highlighted in the presentation is [Agile Software Development. *Principles, Patterns, and Practices*][5] by Bob Martin. The two design patterns we highlight form the book were [single responsibility][2] and [Interface segregation][3].
